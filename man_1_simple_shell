DESCRIPTION
       simple shell is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that
       executes commands read from the standard input or from a file
       
OPTIONS
       All of the single-character shell options documented in the
       description of the set builtin command, can be used
       as options when the shell is invoked.  In addition, simple_shell
       interprets the following options when it is invoked:

       -l     Make simple_shell act as if it had been invoked as a login shell
              (see INVOCATION below).
       -r     If the -r option is present, the shell becomes restricted
              (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).
       -s     If the -s option is present, or if no arguments remain
              after option processing, then commands are read from the
              standard input.  This option allows the positional
              parameters to be set when invoking an interactive shell or
              when reading input through a pipe.
